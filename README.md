Hello! My name is Eric. I graduated from undergradate studies in May 2020 with bachelorâ€™s degrees in mathematics and computer science. I currently work as a software engineer. I plan to pursue a career in the data science field so my main goal for Utica University's MS DS program is to learn the necessary skills to be qualified for and successful in such a career.
